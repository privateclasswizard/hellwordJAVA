            Conversions at this level do not do any narrowing. Typically, this will include

            A somewhat meaningful conversion is possible, but it will quite likely be lossy.
            For eg. BigInteger to an Int32, Boolean to Int32, one-char string to a char,
            larger number type to a smaller numeric type (where there is no overflow), etc
